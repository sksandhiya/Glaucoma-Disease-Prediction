# Glaucoma-Disease-Prediction
Project: Predicting Glaucoma Disease
"Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, the health of which is vital for good vision. 
This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in your eye.
Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60."

Install:
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Code :
Template code is provided in the Glaucoma-Disease-Prediction.ipynb notebook file.

Run: 
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Glaucoma-Disease-Prediction/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook Glaucoma-Disease-Prediction.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook Glaucoma-Disease-Prediction.ipynb

Dataset:
This data set contains images/oct scans of the eye.
dataset can be downmloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/glaucoma-detection

Project Flow:
step 1: Loading the Data, Libraries and other dependencies.
Step 2: Preprocessing the data and batch generation
Step 3: Building the CNN image Classification Model
Step 4: Train the Model using image dataset
Step 5: Evaluating the Performance of the Image Classification Model
